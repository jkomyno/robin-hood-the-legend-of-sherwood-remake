"""Reviewed working-mask revisions for the Lincoln courtyard lane (pure Python).

Only rows of the workspace's own source nodes are changed, in the working
`source-masks.json` that `refinement_workspace` allows each asset to revise.
Every revision records its reason and an evidence image written to the
workspace's `inspection/mask-revisions.png` (artwork | own masks in cyan,
excluded foreground masks in magenta).

Foreground masks were chosen by listing every native mask overlapping the
asset's own masks and inspecting each over the covered artwork:
  68  bush in a tub at the shed's west corner (in front of wall and knee wall)
  121 rail fence in front of the shed's west bay and the hay cart
  173 hay heap inside the shed's west bay (in front of the back wall)
  174 goat inside the shed (in front of the back wall)
  176 manger plank inside the shed (in front of the back wall)
  67  bush against the thatched cottage's west gable
  123 low fence in front of the thatched cottage's west corner
  153 shrub drawn over the south lean-to's west roof edge
  157/161 tree foliage (duplicate layer-0/layer-2 masks) over the west hutch
Parapet masks 187/190/191/192 overlap the south sheds but are already fully
covered by the reviewed curtain exclusions 230/231/232 (residual <= 4 px).
Masks 206/227 (inner gatehouse masonry) lie behind the privy and stay.
