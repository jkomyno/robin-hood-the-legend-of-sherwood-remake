"""Detail pass for lincoln-hall-keep-north-wall (nodes 229, 231, 232).

The two parapets of the hall-to-keep wall walk are rebuilt as continuous notched walls
with real merlons. Merlon shoulders and heights come from the numbered source trace
``inspection/north-wall-merlon-trace.json`` (original covered.png pixels):

- North parapet 231: 9 visible merlons (left shoulders x 1290..1460). Least-squares
  period is 21.33 px and width 13.3 px. Two more merlons under the west-wing roof are
  inferred from that period.
- South parapet 232: 3 visible merlon west ends (x 1331, 1353, 1374), same period. The
  rest are hidden by the west-wing roof, the middle-tower chimney 259 and the east-wing
  roof, so they are inferred from the same period and phase.
- North run: the traced left-shoulder tops and notch floors are the *far* (north, back)
  cap edge of the silhouette. A merlon's top face is seen from above, so its upper
  silhouette is the back edge. These corners are converted with the back-face line and the
  front-face left shoulder is shifted by the wall's x offset (+4.74). The traced right
  shoulder x is the front-right corner, which is the silhouette's rightmost point. The
  native mask 252 upper boundary independently confirms this: step-ups at 1289, 1310,
  1332, ... and a ~3 px drop over the last ~4.7 px of every merlon cap.
- South run: the three traced points are front-face corners, taken at the right edge of
  each shadowed west end face, and are converted with the front-face line.
- Merlon top and notch floor z are per run: the mean of that run's measured corners.

The walk 229 (top z 550) keeps its native shape. The recipe has already cut its pillar
to the 420 ground. The parapet bodies run from the same 420 ground.
