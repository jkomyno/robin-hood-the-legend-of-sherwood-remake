# Nottingham refinement

Nottingham is finished and published. This directory keeps only its pipeline
infrastructure (setup, grouping, source states, workspace preparation, gallery)
and their tests; the per-asset geometry, texture and audit recipes were removed
in the 2026-09-26 Python cleanup and remain in git history (tag
`python-cleanup-base`). They implemented the workflow in
[`../../refinement/PROCEDURE.md`](../../refinement/PROCEDURE.md). Run commands
from the repository root. Generated evidence lives in
`level-editor/work/nottingham-refinement/`.

The initial reviewed grouping was `grouping/catalog-v7.json` (117 selectable
groups owning 555 canonical source parts exactly once); the final catalog is
`grouping/catalog-v15.json`, reached through the removed `revise_catalog_v8…v15`
and `group_scene_v8…v15` migration steps. Terrain has its own additional review
workspace. The market houses form one market terrace with selectable children.

`setup_scene.py` records the source inventory and recovers the omitted thin slab.
`group_scene.py` groups the recovered source without changing world geometry.
`source_states.py` preserves native masks, patches, and animation frames.
`source_review_masks.py` builds explicit receiver constraints. The canonical
V11 baseline contains only existing source nodes; component sidecars are applied
to the owning workspace after its geometry recipe creates those components.
Unknown ownership is represented by a rejection mask and neutral shading.

`freeze_tooling.py` snapshots the shared implementations from
`level-editor/refinement/blender` (plus the Derby recipes in `level-editor/blender`). Recipes select the
snapshot referenced by `tooling/current.json`; changing live shared helpers does
not alter an existing worker's implementation. The machine-wide render slot pool
(`level-editor/refinement/render_slots.py`, three slots) limits expensive Blender work. Use background Blender with
`--threads 2 --python-exit-code 1` and acquire a render slot before loading and
rendering large scenes.

`prepare_assets.py --help` describes frozen workspace preparation. Each asset
keeps immutable `baseline.blend`, `input/`, and source evidence. Run its geometry
recipe on `model.blend`, then regenerate and validate `modified/`. A wider camera
fit requires a new workspace revision with matching input and modified views.
Do not replace frozen input images. `workspace-overrides.json` selects revisions
explicitly; the gallery never guesses the newest directory.

Rebuild and check the pending review gallery:

```sh
python3 level-editor/blender/nottingham/build_gallery.py
node level-editor/blender/nottingham/verify_gallery.mjs
```

The collector calls the current shared HTML generator directly, preserving its
asset-ID/content-hash filenames and stable anchors. The ready-for-review filter
and missing-packet presentation live in that shared generator. Existing render
packets retain their pinned helper versions; new revisions can select a freshly
captured common-tooling snapshot explicitly with `--tooling-dir`.

The builder checks catalog membership, immutable files, mask authority, fixed
cameras, projection partitions, and worker reports bound to model and packet
hashes. `candidate.json` requires an explicit eight-view visual audit and a
description of changes or a justified unchanged-geometry decision. Validation
alone does not establish that refinement is complete. Limitations remain visible.

Candidates can name `revealed_solid`, `revealed_textured`, `revealed_context`,
and `revealed_input` using workspace-relative paths. Animated endpoints use
`animation_states: [{"id": "portcullis-initial", "directory": "..."}]`.
These are complete fixed-camera packets, checked and included in the state
bundle hash. Endpoint cards refer to their parent asset's decision.
Optional `covered_solid`, `covered_textured`, and `covered_context` display the
validated covered state as the primary card while retaining the complete
`modified/` geometry comparison in the evidence.

`gallery-progress.json` lists every group, including missing or invalid packets.
`gallery-packet-evidence/` holds current validation and ownership records; the
gallery retains older review revisions in its history. Worker audit directories
record measured anchors, inferred hidden geometry, source constraints, and
reproducible commands.

Geometry approval is a separate explicit user decision, bound to the model,
modified views, and any state bundle hashes. Pass those records with
`build_gallery.py --approvals <file>`; `approvals.json` is detected by default.
An approved model with a requested projection correction stays visible. A
correction must prove that its geometry hash matches the approved model before
it can return to projection review. Source grouping preferences are not geometry
approval. Texture synthesis and editor publication follow the procedure's
approval gate; an unapproved review packet must not be published.
